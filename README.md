# Dailey-Planner
website:https://adumbcoder.github.io/Dailey-Planner/

This is my daily planner.
You can enter event/tasks into the inputs and hit save and it will keep track of your information.
The current hour will be high lighted as blue, past hours will be in red and future events are a light green.
Used the built-in Date method. Seemed more precise and was easier to use then loading in an outside API.
